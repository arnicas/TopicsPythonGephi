Topic Visualization With Python & Gephi
=================

Files for a workshop at the Graphical Web in Winchester, and the Bodleian, Oxford, 2014. Do read the [installation instructions.](https://github.com/arnicas/TopicsPythonGephi/blob/master/Install%20Directions%20for%20Topic%20Vis%20Workshop.md).

Blog post coming soon... but this workshop takes you through using a directory of fiction samples, running a topic modeler on them, and post-processing the output to import to Gephi.  From Gephi, a sigma.js website is exported. Code is included to do pre-processing on the text files to filter the input by part of speech, etc.  The main workshop instructions live in the files/TopicWorkshop.pdf presentation.

In a subdirectory, there are workshop files for doing a topic analysis on Grimm's fairytales, similar in structure but with fewer python scripts for iterative revision of the input.
