TopicsPythonGephi
=================

Files for creating a topic network using a big text file (or directory of files), IPython nb, Gephi, and Sigma.js.  This project goes thru segmenting a Gutenberg book text file - Grimm's Fairytales, creating a csv file to input to a Topic Analysis gui (also available here: https://code.google.com/p/topic-modeling-tool/), post-processing the results in Python, creating a network to import to Gephi, layout in Gephi, export to Sigma.js interactive web page.
