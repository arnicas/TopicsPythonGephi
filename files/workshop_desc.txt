Workshop:
Visualising Topic Models as Networks

In this tutorial, you will learn how to explore document content visually with topic modeling, a popular unsupervised machine learning technique that can help illuminate text content and relations. The tools used will be Python for simple text processing, a topic modeler (Mallet) with a GUI or command line option, and Gephi and D3 for network visualization.  The workshop is planned so that you can follow along with the code process (and replicate / modify yourself) or just run the simple examples without actually modifying them yourself.

The steps we will take:
1. Pre-process texts for use in topic modeling, using Python scripts.
2. Run topic modeling software on the texts (using a point-and-click GUI).
3. Read in the csv results for use in a visualization, using Python.
4. Generate a network output file for use with Gephi (or D3).
5. Import the data to Gephi to view the network and lay out the graph.
6. Export as a Sigma.js web application; tweak that output as we explore the graph.
7. Time allowing: Use the JSON network format to build a simple D3 network diagram.

The tutorial is intended for novices in topic modeling and is also appropriate for programmers with only a little Python or D3.js experience. If you are new or confused by Gephi, the tutorial will probably help you learn a few tricks for getting good results with it. Note that the topic modeling stage will be treated as a black box for the most part, as the algorithm is not the focus of the course.
