Single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or\\r\\nfive thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How so? How can it affect them?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear Mr. Bennet,\" replied his wife, \"how can you be so tiresome! You\\r\\n ust know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is that his design in settling here?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Design! Nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he\\r\\n_may_ fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as\\r\\nsoon as he comes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send\\r\\nthem by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for as you are\\r\\nas handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley may like you the best of the\\r\\nparty.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear, you flatter me. I certainly _have_ had my share of beauty, but\\r\\nI do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has five\\r\\ngrown-up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into\\r\\nthe neighbourhood.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is more than I engage for, I assure you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would\\r\\nbe for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to\\r\\ngo, merely on that account, for in general, you know, they visit no\\r\\nnewcomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for _us_ to\\r\\nvisit him if you do not.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are over-scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very\\r\\nglad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my\\r\\nhearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls; though\\r\\nI must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the\\r\\nothers; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so\\r\\ngood-humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving _her_ the preference.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They have none of them much to recommend them,\" replied he; \"they are\\r\\nall silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of\\r\\nquickness than her sisters.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr. Bennet, how _can_ you abuse your own children in such a way? You\\r\\ntake delight in vexing me. You have no compassion for my poor nerves.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They\\r\\nare my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration\\r\\nthese last twenty years at least.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah, you do not know what I suffer.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four\\r\\nthousand a year come into the neighbourhood.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you will not\\r\\nvisit them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will visit them\\r\\nall.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n r.
