43,stevenson_treasure_ch2.txt,stevenson,Doc,"IT was not very long after this that there occurred the first of the mysterious events that rid us at last of the captain though not as you will see of his affairs. It was a bitter cold winter with long hard frosts and heavy gales; and it was plain from the first that my poor father was little likely to see the spring. He sank daily and my mother and I had all the inn upon our hands and were kept busy enough without paying much regard to our unpleasant guest.  It was one January morning..."

"Well now Sir Humphry Davy; I dined with him years ago at Cartwright's and Wordsworth was there too--the poet Wordsworth you know.  Now there was something singular.  I was at Cambridge when Wordsworth was there and I never met him--and I dined with him twenty years afterwards at Cartwright's. There's an oddity in things now...."
25,eliot_middlemarch_ch48.txt,eliot,Doc,"Dorothea's distress when she was leaving the church came chiefly from the perception that Mr. Casaubon was determined not to speak to his cousin and that Will's presence at church had served to mark more strongly the alienation between them.  Will's coming seemed to her quite excusable nay she thought it an amiable movement in him towards a reconciliation which she herself had been constantly wishing for.  He had probably imagined as she had that if Mr. Casaubon and he could meet easily th..."

He felt himself becoming violent and unreasonable as if raging under the pain of stings: he was ready to curse the day on which he had come to Mi..."

He had little to bite and to break and once when great dearth fell on the land he could no longer procure even daily bread. Now when he thought over this by night in his bed and tossed about in his anxiety he groaned and said to his wife: 'What is to become of us? How are we to feed our poor children when we no longer have anything even for ourselves?' 'I'll tel..."

21,doyle_redheadedleague.txt,doyle,Doc,"I had called upon my friend Mr. Sherlock Holmes one day in the autumn of last year and found him in deep conversation with a very stout florid-faced elderly gentleman with fiery red hair. With an apology for my intrusion I was about to withdraw when Holmes pulled me abruptly into the room and closed the door behind me.  "You could not possibly have come at a better time my dear Watson" he said cordially.  "I was afraid that you were engaged."  "So I am. Very much so."  "Then I can wait in..."
22,doyle_scandalbohemia.txt,doyle,Doc,"To Sherlock Holmes she is always THE woman. I have seldom heard him mention her under any other name. In his eyes she eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for Irene Adler. All emotions and that one particularly were abhorrent to his cold precise but admirably balanced mind. He was I take it the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen but as a lover he would have placed himself in a false position. He n..."
23,eliot_middlemarch_ch1.txt,eliot,Doc,"Miss Brooke had that kind of beauty which seems to be thrown into relief by poor dress.  Her hand and wrist were so finely formed that she could wear sleeves not less bare of style than those in which the Blessed Virgin appeared to Italian painters; and her profile as well as her stature and bearing seemed to gain the more dignity from her plain garments which by the side of provincial fashion gave her the impressiveness of a fine quotation from the Bible--or from one of our elder poets--in a..."
28,grimms_snowdrop.txt,grimms,Doc,"It was the middle of winter when the broad flakes of snow were falling around that the queen of a country many thousand miles off sat working at her window. The frame of the window was made of fine black ebony and as she sat looking out upon the snow she pricked her finger and three drops of blood fell upon it. Then she gazed thoughtfully upon the red drops that sprinkled the white snow and said 'Would that my little daughter may be as white as that snow as red as that blood and as blac..."
29,grimms_wateroflife.txt,grimms,Doc,"Long before you or I were born there reigned in a country a great way off a king who had three sons. This king once fell very ill--so ill that nobody thought he could live. His sons were very much grieved at their father's sickness; and as they were walking together very mournfully in the garden of the palace a little old man met them and asked what was the matter. They told him that their father was very ill and that they were afraid nothing could save him. 'I know what would' said the li..."
40,meyer_twilight_ch2.txt,meyer,Doc,"THE NEXT DAY WAS BETTER . . . AND WORSE.  It was better because it wasn't raining yet though the clouds were dense and opaque. It was easier because I knew what to expect of my day. Mike came to sit by me in English and walked me to my next class with Chess Club Eric glaring at him all the while; that was flattering. People didn't look at me quite as much as they had yesterday. I sat with a big group at lunch that included Mike Eric Jessica and several other people whose names and faces I..."

However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his  first entering a neighbourhood this truth is so well fixed in the minds  of the surrounding families that he is considered the rightful property  of some one or other of their daughters.

He had always intended to visit him though to the last always assuring his wife that he should not go; and till the evening after the visit was paid she had no knowledge of it.

It was unusually early for him; his whole person exhaled the charm of almost dewy freshness; he wore his blue cloth overcoat unbuttoned; his boots were shiny; his cheeks freshly shaven had a sort of gloss; and even his heavy-lidded eyes refreshed by a night of peaceful slumber sent out glances of comparative alertness.  Through the park railings thes..."
